The spot must be fixed on land (mountain peaks, plateaus, etc.).** How you reach the location is up to you‚Äîhike, climb, bike, or teleport‚Äîjust get there and code.\r\n\r\nThe participant who codes at the highest documented altitude wins eternal glory (**and a cool surprise prize** üèÜ).\r\n\r\nReady to rise above the clouds and leave your mark? üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\r\n\r\nCode high, code proud.",
