At least two people must be physically present at the location where the coding takes place.\r\n- You must provide photo evidence and post it in the official [42 Vienna Slack channel](https://42born2code.slack.com/archives/C05U1PGPQ4V). \r\n- The photo must clearly show the altitude (via GPS device, signage, or screen).\r\n- It must also show a person actively coding on a laptop at that location.\r\n\r\n**Planes, cable cars, or any kind of aircraft or machine do not count. The spot must be fixed on land (mountain peaks, plateaus, etc.).** How you reach the location is up to you‚Äîhike, climb, bike, or teleport‚Äîjust get there and code.\r\n\r\nThe participant who codes at the highest documented altitude wins eternal glory (**and a cool surprise prize** üèÜ).\r\n\r\nReady to rise above the clouds and leave your mark? üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\r\n\r\nCode high, code proud.",

While Generative AI accelerates development, it also increases testing demands, consuming more resources. Focusing only on test quantity doesn't ensure better quality and often isolates QA as the testers' responsibility, rather than a team effort. This leads to inefficiencies, as developers prioritize features over quality, neglecting their role in developer-led testing. Emphasizing holistic quality over test quantity is essential for true business value.*\r\n\r\n- 09:50 - Panel Discussion: Less Testing, Better Quality (Moderator: Nicol Weghofer | Panelists: Sven Schirmer, Martin Klonk, Peter Godoviƒç)\r\n- 10:25 - Coffee Break\r\n- 10:45 - Talk: Becoming a Tester - A Fairy Tale \r\n\r\nExtern Speaker: Tamara Josten\r\n\r\n*I'd like to share my fairy tale of changing careers, overcoming challenges, and entering the world of testing. Along the way, I encountered helpful allies and formidable foes. This journey taught me that diverse skills and backgrounds strengthen teams and companies. By sharing my story, I aim to highlight the value of hiring career changers and the benefits of an agile learning approach. This transformation not only helped me achieve my dream but also reshaped it, showing that everyone can author their own fairy tale.*\r\n\r\n- 11:20 - Talk: Scaling the Heights - Transforming Testing Automation\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Florin Petre\r\n\r\n*In early 2024, the PI Delivery Tribe launched an initiative to revolutionize testing through an Upskilling Testing Automation program. Starting with 25 QA colleagues, it expanded to 135 participants across all delivery tribes. The goals were to upskill 80% of QA staff in test automation and achieve 60% automation coverage for agile products. Despite challenges in stakeholder agreement, budget, and cultural change, support from Group Agile Engineering was crucial to this success story.*\r\n\r\n- 12:00 - Lunch\r\n- 13:00 - Welcome Back (Host: Rudolf Gr√∂tz)\r\n- 13:15 - Talk: Testing in Production \r\n\r\nExtern Speaker: Mykola Gurov\r\n \r\n*Embrace Production as a first-class testing environment to decrease costs and improve quality.\r\nThorough testing before merging to master is great, but it doesn‚Äôt reveal the unknowns. Staging on shared environments tends to be slow, unreliable and costly to support. Why not just learn from the only true environment by conducting safe and efficient experiments?\r\nThis talk is based on my experience of increasing the delivery rate within the context of back-end systems of bol.com (one of the biggest online retailers of the Netherlands; logistics and purchasing domains), where correctness is often a bigger concern than performance, and recovery might require a bit more than users hitting the refresh button of their browser.\r\nTesting on production is often associated with A/B testing or canary releases, but those aren‚Äôt always the best - or even applicable - techniques. We‚Äôll look instead at shadow and dry runs, controlled experiments, survival of the fittest; how to apply these techniques and what to be aware of.*\r\n\r\n- 13:50 - Talk: The Road to QA - An okayish success story\r\n\r\nExtern Speaker: Benjamin Bischoff\r\n \r\n*Throughout my career as a software developer, I‚Äôve observed numerous QA professionals transitioning into test automation roles, with some turning into full-fledged developers. My journey, however, took the opposite path‚ÄîI moved from being a developer to specializing in test automation.\r\nIn this talk, I aim to delve into why this transition felt like a natural progression for me. I‚Äôll share the lessons I learned along the way and how this shift fundamentally altered my perspective on both developers and QA professionals.\r\nMoreover, I‚Äôll touch on the importance of challenging the status quo and how this significantly enhances career development. By questioning your role, you can uncover opportunities for growth that you might not have considered otherwise.*\r\n\r\n- 14:25- Coffee Break\r\n- 14:45 - Talk: Performance Testing\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Ivan Horvat\r\n \r\n*Performance testing is an important part of the software development cycle and is constantly evolving. I will discuss our experience, which started with simplistic, sporadic tests and evolved into a system-wide, systemic testing process involving the cooperation and coordination of different IT departments, agile teams, and business owners.*\r\n\r\n- 15:20 - Talk: FullStack Consumer Driven Contract Testing with CITRUS\r\n\r\nSpeaker: Andreas Halwein\r\n \r\n*Based on my experience in various product teams developing software products and integrating them with systems across organizations and countries, I would like to share some possible tech stacks for automated regression testing at the system test level. \r\nI will then focus on why you should invest in this and share my lessons learned.*\r\n\r\n- 16:00 - Closing Remarks\r\n",

Most of the titles are German, but many of the games are also playable without any knowledge of German (except for those with much text). You are very welcomed to message Barbara on Discord if you have any questions about a special game, if she should check one for playability without knowing German and/or of course if you wish to play it so she should bring it! Lets have some (more) fun together!",

You will also be given access to a Discord channel with all of the caches that you will need to look for. You will then have a whole week to find as many caches as possible. Each caches are worth a different amount of points depending on difficulty (Easy, Medium and Hard). At the end, the three teams with the most points will get some prizes. üéÅ The game will end on **Friday, May 16th at 15:00**, where we will have another event to announce the winners. \r\n\r\n### Prizes \r\n- **1st Place**: Geocaching Winner Achievement + 500 Coalition Points + 100 Altairian Dollars + Intranet Title \r\n- **2nd Place**: 250 Coalition Points + 75 Altairian Dollars \r\n- **3rd Place**: 125 Coalition Points + 50 Altairian Dollars \r\n\r\nEach participant will also receive a **Geocaching Achievement**.",
